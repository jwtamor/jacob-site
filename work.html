                    As an Electrical Engineering Intern at Square, 
                    I designed a PCB using Altium to monitor the 
                    battery power behavior in the 2nd generation 
                    Square Reader. The board is connected to the 
                    reader and the battery, measures voltage and 
                    current output from the battery, and logs that 
                    information to be analyzed later. Additionally, 
                    the PCB is equipped with a discharging module 
                    that to analyze the reader in low power mode. 
                    I designed both the schematic and layout of the 
                    board, as well as sourced the components for 
                    current monitoring, power, and discharging. 
                    I also made prototypes and simulations in order 
                    to provide a proof of concept for each of the 
                    board modules.

                    My time as an Optical Engineering Intern and Assitant 
                    at Calix allowed me to practice software and hardware 
                    interaction. During my summer internship there, I 
                    fronted the projects for automating the qualification 
                    tests for optical equipment. These automation scripts 
                    remotely accessed the device under test in order to 
                    receive information and run the qualifications. The 
                    Vice President of Hardware Engineering eventually 
                    evaluated this model and mandated the work on hardware 
                    automation. I continued to work throughout the school 
                    year where i constructed models and simulations in 
                    Python in order to guide the understanding of 
                    signal attenuation and its practical consequences.

                    Rev: Ithaca Startup Works is a start up workspace that 
                    I worked at part-time during the school year. The 
                    company offers resources and mentorship for growing 
                    businesses. In my role as a Hardware Instructor, I built 
                    circuit prototypes, as well as coding for embedded systems 
                    framework, for various start-ups in different fields. 
                    Additionally I designed PCB's made for early-version 
                    testing in the field. Two projects I have worked on 
                    include remote controlled electrical networks for 
                    landlords, and an electrical interface/display for 
                    automating biochemical tests.
