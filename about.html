                        I grew up in a town called Alameda in California.
                        Growing up, I had always been fascinated with learning
                        math and science in school, and had a penchant for
                        teaching myself parts of those subjects outside of what
                        I learned in class. When I came to college, I decided to
                        enter the field of engineering because I have always
                        been a problem solver, and I always had a fascination
                        with solving puzzles.

                        Though I am from California, and enduring the cold is
                        not my forte, I can't deny how pretty the snow is in the
                        winter. Here is a cozy picture I took from my apartment
                        in Ithaca!

                        Throughout high school, I played tennis, and I still try
                        to play as much as possible in college. Here's a picture
                        of me serving at the Cornell tennis courts!

                        At home, I have the cutest dogs! On the left is a
                        pomeranian-poodle named Oski and on the right is a
                        golden retriever labrador named Kona.

                        When I find myself with free time, I love to whip out a
                        jigsaw puzzle. I like to challenge myself with puzzles
                        with more and more pieces. Here's a puzzle of Michonne
                        from The Walking Dead series!

                        Also, I'll take any chance to capture a beautiful
                        sunset, and luckily, I can find a lot of them in Ithaca,
                        and in Alameda. This is one of my favorite sunsets from
                        Ithaca!

                Another one of my hobbies is trying new foods, and I am always
                looking forward to going on a new tasting adventure. Here's some
                of my favorite dishes!
