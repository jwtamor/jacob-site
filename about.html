                    I grew up in a small town near Oakland, California. Growing
                    up, I had always been fascinated with learning math and
                    science in school, and had a penchant for teaching myself
                    parts of those subjects outside of what I learned in class.
                    When I came to college, I decided to enter the field of
                    engineering because I have always been a problem solver, and
                    I always had a fascination with solving puzzles.
