            <h1>C1C0 Robot Sensors System</h1>
            <p>
                This sensors system of my design was used for the C1C0 robot for
                Cornell Cup Robotics Team (visit the <a
                    href="https://cornellcuprobotics.com/">team website</a> to
                learn more about the projects). The goal of this system was to
                quickly and efficinetly collect sensor data from peripheral
                microcontrollers, package that data, and transmit it to the
                robot's main opearating system so that it can be used for object
                detection and autonomous navigation purposes. The scope of my
                work for this project was writing the firmware code that
                collects, organizes, and transmits data to the robot's OS, as
                well as write the Python code that abstracts the data collection
                and decomposition into an API for software algorithms to use.

                The figures above demonstrate the breakout board used for the
                Teensy microcontroller and the associated wiring for the
                connections of each sensors. The system is composed of one 360
                degree LiDAR sensor, three strips of Terabee IR sensors, and one
                IMU. Both the LiDAR and the IR sensors use UART to communicate
                its information to the data collecting microcontroller, and the
                IMU uses I2C. Additinoally, the Teensy uses UART to transmit its
                information to the robot's OS.

                The picture below shows a connectivity example between the LiDAR
                sensor (top center), the robot's opearting system (top left),
                and the sensor data collecting microcontroller (Teensy).

                In the firmware, I designed the framework to collect the data
                from each sensor and store it in thier respective arrays. After
                this collection, the arrays would all be concatonated togther
                such that the array has each sensor data listed one after the
                other. Once collected, the data is encoded for UART transmission
                using R2Protocol (an enocding and transmission strategy
                developed by an alumnus of the team). This encoded data is then
                sent to the robot's main operating system, which then uses
                Python to decode that data and organize the large array into
                separate, sensor specific arrays. To ensure simple access to
                software algorithms, I also designed an API with simple callable
                functions that ensure easy access to the data from specific
                sensors.
            </p>

                My work on this project has helped me to gain an understanding
                of the I2C and UART communication protocols, and specifically
                learn how to debug these protocols. Additionally, this project
                has allowed me to practice API development and code abstraction
                in which I have learned how to best relay information in ways
                that are useful. Along with this, I was able to strengthen my
                communication skills by working in a team working toward the
                same goal; this skill was especially refined for working with
                interdisciplinary teams that do not necessarily have the same
                technical expertise as the work that I am doing.
