            <h1>Sound Filtering Integrated Circuit</h1>
            <img src="Images/analog_final_circuit.png">
            <p>
                This circuit was made as the final project for ECE 4530: Analog
                Integrated Circuit Design (final submitted circuit shown above).
                The goal of this project was to construct an audio based circuit
                that will be able to output different voltage levels that
                correspond to the amplitudes of the specific frequency ranges we
                choose. The idea of this circuit setup is to be able to use the
                output voltages as an indicator for applications such as LEDs
                with visual aesthetics to match the music. Even beyond a light
                show, there are speakers that use these kinds of circuits in
                order to amplify the different frequency registers separately so
                that the "loudness" of different frequencies as heard by the
                human ear can be preserved.

                This project was designed in Cadence Virtuoso, and since there
                was no fabrication of the product, in-depth analyses of
                simulatinos were performed on the circuits. My portion of the
                project was the filter amplifier design for the frequency middle
                range (250Hz-4kHz), as well as desigining the AC-DC convrters at
                the output of each frequency filter in order to capture a
                voltage level that corresponds to AC amplitude.

                The schematic below is the RC amplifier that I designed for the
                middle frequency range.

                I designed this to be a singular amplifier to acheive second
                order filtering at both the cutoff frequencies. The second order
                filtering is achevied by taking advantage of the various signal
                paths of the amplifier: input, output, and feedback paths.

                The schematic above shows my design of the AC-DC converter used
                to extract the peak amplitudes of the filter's output. The
                amplifier shown above is not actually included in the converter's
                design, but it simply there to reperesent the input. The design
                is a diode-bridge rectifier that takes advantage of the
                unidirectional current flow of the diodes in order to extract
                the positive voltage signal. The signal across the diode bridge
                is then treated with a resistor and capacitor network in order
                to smooth out the signal.

                Through this project and the course in general, I gained
                in-depth experience using Cadence Virtuoso to create both
                schematics and layouts for integrated circuits, specifically for
                signal amplifiers. I also learned how to verify designs using
                the simulation software of the application, being able to
                analyze circuits in the frequency and analog domain. Through
                these simulations I've learned to be able to observe phenomena
                that occur and be able to pinpoint their causes in the circuit.
