                    This game remote was developed for the course ECE 3140:
                    Embedded Systems. The system is an expansion upon
                    my final project for the course CS 1110: Introduction to
                    Python, in which I coded a Frogger-like video game. The
                    controller is designed such that there are tilts that
                    control the frog's movements around the screen. For this
                    project, the FRDM-KL46Z development board was used and
                    <strong>programmed in C</strong>.

                The video above displays the overview of the controller system.

            <p>
                This system takes advantage of the on-board IMU of the
                FRDM-KL46Z development board. The program that runs on the board
                constantly reads the <strong>IMU</strong> using an <strong>I2C
                    bus</strong>, and detects the tilting direction based on
                that IMU data. In order to avoid repeating tilts upon movement,
                an FSM was implemented in the tilting detection, analgous to a
                <strong>debouncing FSM</strong>
                for button presses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the actual video game is implemented in Python and run
                from a computer, the FRDM-KL46Z transmits its information to the
                computer. This is done using <strong>UART transmission</strong>,
                which is simple to do because the cable used to program and
                power the board acts as a viable serial line that the
                development board can communicate with. This communication is
                done by sending a string that corresponds to the direction of
                tilting, and the pyserial module in python is able to read the
                computer's serial port and retrieve the transmitted information.
